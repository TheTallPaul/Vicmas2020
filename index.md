## How we're doing 2020

Traditionally, every December our house known as 'The Vic' hosts a large Christmas party known as 'Vicmas'.
However that's obviously not possible this year (but stay tuned for Vicmas in July), so we've found a new to turn this year's Vicmas into a positive by hosting a fundraiser.


### What is City Team?

Watch [our video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTpA8z9zwR8) to hear more about the good City Team is bringing to the world!

### Money Multiplier

The members of the Vic will be donating two dollars for every dollar in proceeds for the first $400 dollars.
Coupled with a generous backer offering to double all City Team donations this month up to $250k, that means that every $1 in proceeds will equate to $5 in donations for the first $400!

### Mugs!

For every $10 you donate, we will give you a custom diner-style mug!
Mug costs vary depending on order quantity, but will be aproximately $3.

Mugs will be available _only_ for porch-side pickup at The Vic in SE Portland.
Of course, if you don't want a mug, you're free to donate anyways.

### Donate

Be sure to include "City Team" or "Vicmas" in your message so we know that this is earmarked for donations.
Put "Mug" in your message along with the name and number of the person who'll be picking it up if you want a mug.
