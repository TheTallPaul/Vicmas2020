## How we're doing Vicmas in 2020

Traditionally, every December our house known as 'The Vic' hosts a large Christmas party known as 'Vicmas'.
However that's obviously not possible this year (but stay tuned for Vicmas in July), so we've found a new way to celebrate this year's Vicmas by hosting a fundraiser for an organization one of our residents is an executive director ofâ€”City Team.

## What is City Team?

[City Team](cityteam.org) is an organization devoted to sharing the love of Jesus through meeting the needs of the local community.
City Team provides housing and restorative programs for people struggling with homelessness and addiction, provides food for families dealing with food insecurity, and education programs to help people find living-wage jobs.

Watch [our video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTpA8z9zwR8) to hear more about the good City Team is bringing to the world this season.

## The Fundraiser

We'll be running our fundraiser for one week, from right now through the end of December 27th.

Too late to donate to us or we don't support a payment platform you use?
Feel free to [donate directly to City Team](https://cityteam.org/donate/) instead.

### Money Multiplier ðŸ’¸

We will have every $1 in proceeds matched by $2, up to $400 dollars.
Coupled with a generous backer offering to match City Team donations this month up to $250k, that means that every $1 in proceeds will effectively equate to $5 in donations for the first $400!

### Mugs â˜•

For every $10 you donate, we will happily provide you with a custom diner-style mug!
Mug costs vary depending on order quantity, but will be roughly $3 per mug.
The remaining proceeds of your donation will be delivered directly to City Team.

Mugs will be available **only** for porch pickup at The Vic in Southeast Portland.
We will not be shipping any.
Of course, if you don't want a mug or are unable to pick one up, you're free to donate anyways.
Just include "No mug" in your donation message.

### Donate

To avoid fees associated with GoFundMe, we'll be using Venmo and Paypal.

**Venmo:** @IsaacFulmer

**Paypal:** IsaacFulmer@Gmail.com

Be sure to include "City Team" or "Vicmas" in your message so we know that this is earmarked for donations instead of people randomly sending Isaac money.

If you if you want a mug, put "Mug" in your message along with the name and phone number or email of the person who'll be picking it up.
That way we'll be able to notify you when your mug is ready for pickup.
If you want multiple mugs, donate the appropriate amount and include the number of mugs you'd like to pick up in your message.
